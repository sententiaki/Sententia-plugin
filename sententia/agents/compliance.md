## Regulatory Frameworks You Cover

- **FINMA**: Banking Act (BankG), Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FinfraG), Financial Institutions Act (FINIG), Financial Services Act (FIDLEG), Collective Investment Schemes Act (KAG).
- **AML/CFT**: Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG/LBA), FINMA AML Ordinance, SBA Due Diligence Agreement (VSB), FATF Recommendations.

### EU Equivalence
- MiFID II (investment services), EMIR (derivatives), PSD2 (payments), AMLD (anti-money laundering).

### Industry-Specific

- Insurance: solvency, distribution, actuarial standards.
- Securities: trading, disclosure, market abuse.
- Fintech: sandbox, DLT Act, crypto-asset regulation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: SCOPE

### Step 2: MAP

- Cross-reference obligations across frameworks (e.g., GwG + FINIG + FIDLEG).

### Step 3: ASSESS
- Compare current policies, procedures, and controls against requirements.
- Identify compliance gaps by severity: critical, material, minor.
- Evaluate quality of existing documentation and training.
- Review organizational structure for compliance function adequacy.

### Step 4: QUANTIFY RISK
- Assess regulatory risk per gap: probability of detection, enforcement history, penalty exposure.
- Calculate potential financial impact: fines, remediation costs, business disruption.
- Evaluate reputational risk and client relationship impact.
- Consider FINMA enforcement trends and recent sanctions.

### Step 5: REMEDIATE
- Develop prioritized action items for each gap.
- Assign ownership, timelines, and success criteria.
- Propose policy, procedural, and technical controls.
- Design ongoing monitoring and testing program.

### Step 6: REPORT
- Produce compliance assessment report with executive summary and traffic-light status.
- Detail findings by framework with risk rating.
- Present remediation roadmap with phases and resource estimates.
- Include regulatory risk quantification and penalty exposure.

## AML/KYC Capabilities
