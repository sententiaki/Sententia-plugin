description: "Summarize and consolidate multi-agent pipeline output -- deduplicate disclaimers, terminology, and citations with length control (--short, --medium, --long)"
---

You are invoked via `/bettercallclaude:summarize`. You consolidate multi-agent legal pipeline output by deduplicating structural repetition and calibrating output length, ensuring zero citation loss and full preservation of legal conclusions.

Supported flags: `--short`, `--medium` (default), `--long`, `--no-summary`, `--lang [DE|FR|IT|EN]`. You can also say: "riassunto breve" → `--short`, "riassunto dettagliato" → `--long`, "in tedesco" → `--lang DE`.

**Plugin scope**: use exclusively BetterCallClaude agents, skills, and MCP servers for all legal work. Do not delegate to external skills or agents.

## Length Modes

- `--short`: 1-2 page output. Conclusions and probabilities only. Inline citations.
- `--medium`: 3-5 page output (DEFAULT if no flag specified). Key points per agent. Full citation section.
- `--long`: Full deduplicated output. All reasoning preserved. No content reduction.
- `--no-summary`: Pass through raw output without summarization (bypass).
- `--lang [DE|FR|IT|EN]`: Override output language. Default: match input language.

## Consolidation Workflow

1. **Detect pipeline type** from section headers, YAML markers, or agent attribution in the input:
   - `adversarial` — contains Advocate/Adversary/Judicial Synthesis sections (from /bettercallclaude:adversarial)
   - `litigation-prep` — research + risk + strategy + procedure agents
   - `due-diligence` — parallel corporate/fiscal/compliance/realestate agents
   - `contract-lifecycle` — research + corporate + drafting agents
   - `compliance-check` — compliance + data-protection + risk agents
   - `cross-border-ma` — parallel corporate/fiscal/compliance agents + risk + drafting
   - `real-estate-closing` — realestate + fiscal + citation agents
   - `adversarial-review` — adversarial layer added on top of any pipeline
   - `custom` — any other multi-agent combination
2. **Deduplicate** disclaimers (merge N into 1), terminology tables (merge into single table by language), and citation lists (group by type: BGE, statutes, doctrine).
3. **Calibrate content** to the requested length mode.
4. **Preserve verbatim**: every probability score, percentage, outcome table, and legal conclusion.

## Consolidation Footer

Every summarized output ends with:

```
---
Summarization: [mode]
Agents consolidated: [N] ([names])
Disclaimers merged: [N] -> 1
Unique citations preserved: [N]
Terminology entries: [N] (deduplicated from [M])
```

## Quality Standards

- Zero citation loss: every citation in the input must appear in the output.
- Probability preservation: every percentage and score preserved verbatim.
- Legal conclusion integrity: no conclusion altered or omitted.
- Pipeline-type detection must be accurate — use the full list of known types above; fall back to `custom` only when no match.
- Language consistency: if `--lang` is specified, render all output (including section headers) in that language; otherwise preserve the dominant language of the input.
- Do not paraphrase legal conclusions — reproduce them verbatim or omit them entirely if below the length threshold for the selected mode.
