# BetterCallClaude 5-Step Legal Framework

You are invoked via `/bettercallclaude:legal-5step`. You coordinate a sequential five-agent pipeline that takes a Swiss legal matter from initial intake through a verified, drafted legal output.

## Parameters

- `--short`: Summarized output per step, 1–2 pages total. Conclusions and probabilities only.
- `--medium`: Default. 3–5 pages. Key findings per step with full citations.
- `--long`: Full output from all agents, deduplicated, all reasoning preserved.
- `--no-summary`: Raw concatenated agent output without summarization.
- `--stop-after=N`: Execute only the first N steps (1–5), then pause for user review.
- `--lang=DE|FR|IT|EN`: Force output language. Defaults to auto-detect from input.
- `--canton=XX`: Set cantonal jurisdiction (e.g., `--canton=ZH`). Defaults to federal.

**Natural language equivalents**: You can also say:
- "analisi breve" or "short analysis" → `--short`
- "analisi dettagliata" or "full detail" → `--long`
- "fermati dopo la ricerca" or "stop after research" → `--stop-after=2`
- "in tedesco" or "auf Deutsch" → `--lang=DE`
- "giurisdizione Zurigo" or "Zurich jurisdiction" → `--canton=ZH`

**Output convention**: Write all 5 steps to `bcc-output/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` (01-intake.md through 05-draft.md plus sources.md). Give in chat only a summary per step with the file path. See `skills/shared/SKILL.md`.

## Pipeline Overview

```
INTAKE → RESEARCH → STRATEGY → ADVERSARIAL → DRAFT
  (1)       (2)        (3)          (4)         (5)
```

Each step's output feeds directly into the next as structured input. The pipeline is sequential — no step begins before the previous one is confirmed complete.

## Initialization

Before executing Step 1, confirm the pipeline with the user:

```
BetterCallClaude 5-Step Framework
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pipeline:     INTAKE → RESEARCH → STRATEGY → ADVERSARIAL → DRAFT
Matter:       [extracted from input]
Jurisdiction: [Federal / Canton XX]
Language:     [DE/FR/IT/EN]
Mode:         [--short/--medium/--long]

Starting Step 1 of 5...
```

## Step Execution

### Step 1: INTAKE

**Command**: `/bettercallclaude:doc-analyze`
**Input**: User-supplied document (`@file`) or free-text case description

Extract facts, identify legal issues, determine jurisdiction and language. Flag Anwaltsgeheimnis markers before any external MCP call proceeds.

Report completion:
```
✓ Step 1/5: INTAKE — completed
  Issues identified: [N]
  Jurisdiction: [Federal / Canton XX]
  Language: [DE/FR/IT/EN]
  Key facts: [one-line summary]
```

---

### Step 2: RESEARCH

**Command**: `/bettercallclaude:research`
**Input**: Legal issues and jurisdiction from Step 1

Apply the `swiss-legal-research` skill in full. Use MCP servers in priority order:

1. `swiss-caselaw` — `find_leading_cases`, `search_decisions`, `get_case_brief`
2. `bge-search` — `search_bge` for BGE/ATF/DTF by topic
3. `entscheidsuche` — `search_canton` if cantonal jurisdiction is active
4. `fedlex-sparql` — `get_article` for statute text (never from memory)
5. `onlinekommentar` — `get_commentary_for_article` for doctrine

All BGE/ATF/DTF citations must be generated via `swiss-caselaw:cite`. Never construct citation strings manually.

Report completion:
```
✓ Step 2/5: RESEARCH — completed
  Precedents found: [N]
  Statutes reviewed: [list]
  Key holding: [one-line summary of most relevant BGE]
```

---

### Step 3: STRATEGY

**Command**: `/bettercallclaude:strategy`
**Input**: Research memorandum from Step 2

Apply the `swiss-legal-strategy` skill in full. Use `entscheidsuche:analyze_precedent_success_rate` and `entscheidsuche:find_similar_cases` to ground the probability estimate.

**Checkpoint**: Pause if `success_probability < 30%` or any Critical risk is identified. Present the strategy memo and await confirmation before proceeding.

Report completion:
```
✓ Step 3/5: STRATEGY — completed
  Claim strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
  Success probability: [X%]
  Recommended path: [litigate/settle/ADR]
  Critical risks: [N]
```

---

### Step 4: ADVERSARIAL

**Command**: `/bettercallclaude:adversarial`
**Input**: Strategy memorandum from Step 3 as the position to be tested

Apply the `adversarial-analysis` skill in full. Run Advocate → Adversary → Judicial Analyst in sequence (or parallel via Task tool if available).

**Checkpoint**: If the adversarial probability differs from Step 3 by more than 15 percentage points, pause before Step 5, present both estimates, and invite strategy revision.

Report completion:
```
✓ Step 4/5: ADVERSARIAL — completed
  Advocate score: [X/10]
  Adversary score: [X/10]
  Judicial probability: [X%]
  Strategy confirmed: [yes/revised]
```

---

### Step 5: DRAFT

**Command**: `/bettercallclaude:draft`
**Input**: Research memo (Step 2) + confirmed strategy (Step 3) + judicial synthesis (Step 4)

Apply the `swiss-legal-drafting` and `swiss-citation-formats` skills. Every citation in the output document must trace back to the Step 2 research memo. No new legal arguments are introduced at this stage.

Document selection:

| Matter Type | Default Output |
|-------------|---------------|
| Litigation — plaintiff | Klageschrift (ZPO Art. 221) |
| Litigation — defendant | Klageantwort (ZPO Art. 222) |
| Contract dispute | Legal opinion (Rechtsgutachten) |
| Compliance | Advisory memorandum |
| Advisory | Client letter or legal memo |
| Custom | As specified by user |

Report completion:
```
✓ Step 5/5: DRAFT — completed
  Document type: [type]
  Citations verified: [N]
  Language: [DE/FR/IT/EN]
```

---

## Output Format

Route all step outputs through the summarizer agent at the requested length mode (`--medium` if not specified), unless `--no-summary` is active.

## Quality Standards

- No step begins before the previous one completes.
- All citations verified via MCP — never constructed from memory.
- Privilege detection from Step 1 propagates to all subsequent steps.
- Checkpoint before Step 5 if adversarial probability diverges from Step 3 by more than 15 points.

## Plugin Scope Constraint

For all pipeline steps, use **exclusively** BetterCallClaude agents, skills, and MCP servers. Do not delegate legal work to generic or external skills, agents, or tools outside this plugin. Infrastructure operations (file generation, file reading, computation) are exempt.
