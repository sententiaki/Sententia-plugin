<p align="center"><strong>Swiss Legal Intelligence Plugin for Cowork Desktop</strong></p>

BetterCallClaude transforms legal research, case strategy, and document drafting for Swiss lawyers. It provides deep integration with Swiss legal databases, multi-lingual analysis (DE/FR/IT/EN), and built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege) protection -- 20 agents, 24 commands, 12 skills, and 9 MCP servers covering BGE/ATF/DTF precedent research, litigation strategy, adversarial analysis, legal drafting, citation verification, document intelligence, NDA triage, and CAS/TAS sports arbitration across all 26 Swiss cantons.

> **Claude Code CLI users**: this repository is Cowork Desktop only. The CLI version is at [fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli](https://github.com/fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli).

## Swiss Law, Not Delaware

Anthropic's official Legal plugin (`anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins`) provides contract review and NDA triage for US law (Delaware, New York, California). **BetterCallClaude covers Switzerland**: federal law, all 26 cantons, four national languages, verified citations from official sources, and attorney-client privilege protection.

The two plugins coexist. For Swiss-law matters, BetterCallClaude takes precedence. For US-law matters, the Anthropic plugin applies.

| | Anthropic Legal Plugin | BetterCallClaude Swiss |
|---|---|---|
| **Jurisdiction** | US (DE/NY/CA default) | Switzerland (federal + 26 cantons) |
| **Primary sources** | Model knowledge | 8+ MCP servers on official sources (BGE, Fedlex, entscheidsuche, ...) |
| **Languages** | EN | DE/FR/IT/EN |
| **Citations** | -- | Swiss standards verified via MCP (BGE/ATF/DTF) |
| **Attorney-client privilege** | -- | Privacy-routing hook (Art. 321 StGB) |
| **Adversarial analysis** | -- | 3-agent advocate/adversary/judge with probability scores |
| **NDA triage** | GREEN/YELLOW/RED (US criteria) | GREEN/YELLOW/RED (Swiss criteria: Art. 160 ff. OR, Lugano, zwingendes Recht) |
| **Local playbook** | `legal.local.md` | `bettercallclaude.local.md` (+ `legal.local.md` compat) |

See [MIGRATION-FROM-ANTHROPIC-LEGAL.md](docs/MIGRATION-FROM-ANTHROPIC-LEGAL.md) for the full migration and coexistence guide.

## Overview

BetterCallClaude provides a structured methodology for handling legal work with AI assistance. The framework consists of five interconnected phases.

## What's New in v4.8.3

**v4.8.3 — MCP tool fixes, CONNECTORS documentation, widget integration hooks.**

- **MCP tool name corrections**: fixed incorrect tool probe names in `doctor.md` (`search_personas` → `legal_analyze`, `search_tas_awards` → `cas_search`). Corrected `legal-persona` description across `doctor`, `help`, `version`, and `README`.
- **CONNECTORS.md completed**: documented all 9 MCP servers with full tool specifications. Added `legal-persona` (3 tools), `tas-jurisprudence` (4 tools), `swiss-caselaw` (SSE, opencaselaw.ch).
- **Widget hooks**: conditional invocation of `present_adversarial_analysis` (W2 dashboard) in adversarial-analysis, `present_intake_form` (W4 form) in legal-intake, `compute_deadlines` in swiss-legal-strategy. All with graceful text fallback when tools unavailable.

**Content counts**: 20 agents, 24 commands, 12 skills, 9 MCP servers.

[Full changelog →](CHANGELOG.md)

**Cowork Desktop dedicated release** -- This repository is exclusively for Claude Cowork Desktop. The Claude Code CLI version is at [fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli](https://github.com/fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli).

- **HTTP-only transport**: 8 of 9 MCP servers connect via `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` / `mcp.opencaselaw.ch` -- no local Node.js build required for those
- **Local STDIO server** (`ollama`): bundled and only touches `http://localhost:11434` for privacy-routed translation/summarisation
- **Onboarding**: `/bettercallclaude:start` guides you from installation to first deliverable

## Key Features

- **Briefing sessions** -- Complex queries trigger a collaborative intake phase with specialist panels, targeted questions, and structured execution plans before agents start working. Supports `--resume` for cross-session persistence.
- **Adversarial analysis** -- Three-agent workflow: advocate builds the case, adversary challenges it, judicial analyst synthesizes using Swiss Erwagung methodology with probability scores.
- **Multi-agent workflows** -- Predefined pipelines for due diligence, litigation prep, contract lifecycle, and real estate closings.
- **All 26 cantons** -- Full cantonal coverage with court systems, citation formats, and MCP search via entscheidsuche.ch. Federal law is the default; mentioning a canton triggers cantonal mode.
- **Multi-language** -- Automatic language detection for DE/FR/IT/EN with correct legal terminology and citation formats.

## MCP Servers

All servers connect automatically after installation. No configuration required.

| Server | Purpose | Transport |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `entscheidsuche` | Swiss court decision search (Bundesgericht + cantonal) | HTTP |
| `bge-search` | Federal Supreme Court decision search | HTTP |
| `legal-citations` | Citation verification and formatting | HTTP |
| `fedlex-sparql` | Federal legislation database (SPARQL) | HTTP |
| `onlinekommentar` | Swiss legal commentaries | HTTP |
| `legal-persona` | Swiss-law document intelligence (strategy, drafting, analysis) | HTTP |
| `tas-jurisprudence` | CAS/TAS sports arbitration decisions | HTTP |
| `swiss-caselaw` | Case law, citation graphs, appeal chains (opencaselaw.ch) | SSE |
| `ollama` | Local privacy classification for Anwaltsgeheimnis | Local |

The seven HTTP servers connect to `https://mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` (rate limit: 60 req/min per IP). The `swiss-caselaw` server connects to `https://mcp.opencaselaw.ch`. No API keys required for any server.

See [CONNECTORS.md](bettercallclaude/CONNECTORS.md) for detailed API documentation.

## Privacy

BetterCallClaude includes a built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege, Art. 321 StGB) detection hook as an additional layer of protection. A `PreToolUse` hook scans outgoing tool calls for privilege indicators in German, French, Italian, and English before content leaves the machine. Strong privilege markers (e.g. Anwaltsgeheimnis, secret professionnel, Art. 321 StGB) trigger a confirmation prompt; weaker indicators (e.g. bare "vertraulich", "confidentiel") also prompt when legal context is detected. The user always retains the ability to approve or reject.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` | Same pattern matching as balanced but blocks (`deny`) instead of prompting. Content without privilege markers passes through so MCP servers remain usable. Ollama (local) always exempt. |
| `balanced` | Strong privilege markers prompt for confirmation (`ask`). Weak markers with legal context also prompt. Non-privileged content processed normally. Default mode. |
| `cloud` | Strong privilege markers prompt for confirmation (`ask`). Weak markers allowed without prompt. Maximum capability, reduced privacy. |

> **Disclaimer**: Privacy routing is an assistive technology and does not guarantee compliance with Art. 321 StGB or Art. 13 BGFA. Lawyers remain professionally responsible for protecting client confidentiality. Always verify that appropriate privacy measures are in place before processing sensitive legal content.

> **Known limitations**: The hook uses regex-based pattern matching on text content. Concatenated keywords (e.g. `segretoprofessionale`), accent variations, content encoded as base64, and content inside binary file attachments may bypass detection. The hook is designed to catch accidental leakage, not adversarial evasion. For Bash commands, file paths referencing privileged directories are checked, but the actual file content is not read.

## For Developers

This repo contains the plugin only (agents, commands, skills, hooks, `.mcp.json`, and the bundled `ollama` local STDIO server). MCP server source code and the HTTP aggregator deployed to Railway at `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` live in the separate [`fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP`](https://github.com/fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP) repo.

```bash
npm run package        # Create distributable plugin zip
```

To change an MCP server's behaviour, open a PR in
[`fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP`](https://github.com/fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP).
Railway auto-redeploys on merge to `main`.
