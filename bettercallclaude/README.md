# BetterCallClaude

## Swiss Legal Intelligence Plugin for Cowork and Claude Code

BetterCallClaude is a plugin for legal professionals working in Cowork or Claude Code. It transforms legal research, case strategy, and document drafting for Swiss lawyers by providing deep integration with Swiss legal databases, multi-lingual analysis across German, French, Italian, and English, and built-in privacy protection for attorney-client privilege.

The plugin covers the full spectrum of Swiss legal work: BGE/ATF/DTF precedent research, case strategy development with risk assessment, adversarial legal analysis, compliance and data protection advisory, fiscal and corporate law expertise, real estate law, legal drafting with jurisdiction-aware templates, legal translation, and citation verification across all 26 Swiss cantons. Privacy compliance with Anwaltsgeheimnis (Art. 321 StGB) is enforced automatically through a pre-tool-use hook that detects privileged content before it leaves the local environment.

**Version**: 4.8.3 -- 20 agents, 24 commands, 12 skills, 9 MCP servers.

### Briefing and Orchestration Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| **Advocate** | Builds the strongest possible case in favor of a legal position with supporting BGE precedents and doctrine. |
| **Adversary** | Challenges a legal position by finding weaknesses, counter-precedents, and opposing arguments. |
| **Judicial Analyst** | Neutral synthesis of advocate and adversary positions using Swiss Erwagung (consideration) structure with risk probabilities. |

### Adversarial Analysis Workflow

The adversarial analysis workflow uses three agents in sequence to provide balanced legal assessment:

1. **Advocate** builds the strongest case for the position, identifying supporting precedents, statutory provisions, and doctrinal authority.
2. **Adversary** challenges the position systematically, finding counter-precedents, doctrinal criticism, factual weaknesses, and procedural obstacles.
3. **Judicial Analyst** synthesizes both positions using Swiss Erwagung methodology, assigning probability scores to each legal issue and recommending a course of action.

Invoke with `/bettercallclaude:adversarial` followed by the legal question.

### Multi-Agent Workflows

The workflow orchestrator supports predefined pipelines:

| Workflow | Pipeline | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `due-diligence` | Researcher -> Compliance -> Corporate -> Risk | Corporate due diligence with regulatory and risk assessment. |
| `litigation-prep` | Researcher -> Strategist -> Adversarial -> Drafter | Full litigation preparation with adversarial stress-testing. |
| `contract-lifecycle` | Drafter -> Compliance -> Citation -> Translator | Contract creation with compliance review and translation. |
| `real-estate-closing` | Real Estate -> Compliance -> Fiscal -> Drafter | Real estate transaction with regulatory and tax analysis. |

Invoke with `/bettercallclaude:workflow` followed by the workflow name and case description.

### Briefing Session (New in v3.1.0)

Complex legal matters often involve multiple domains, jurisdictions, and competing considerations that a single query cannot fully capture. BetterCallClaude previously used a one-shot classification: the `/legal` gateway would read your query, score its complexity, and immediately route to agents. This worked well for focused questions but led to misrouted or incomplete analysis when the initial query lacked critical context.

The **briefing session** adds a collaborative intake phase between your query and agent execution. Instead of guessing what you need, the system assembles a panel of specialist agents, asks you targeted questions, and builds a precise execution plan before any work begins.

**How it works**:

1. **Adaptive activation** -- The `/legal` gateway scores your query's complexity (1-10). Simple queries (1-3) route directly as before. Moderate queries (4-6) trigger 2-3 inline clarifying questions. Complex queries (7-10) enter a full briefing session with a specialist panel.

2. **Specialist panel** -- For complex queries, the briefing coordinator selects 2-5 agents from a pool of 10 specialists (researcher, strategist, procedure, risk, compliance, drafter, corporate, fiscal, real estate, cantonal). Each panelist is spawned as a real subagent and returns domain-specific questions based on your query.

3. **Transparent attribution** -- Every question is labeled with which specialist needs the answer and why. You see exactly who is asking (e.g., "Needed by: ⏱️ Procedure (deadline calculation), 📊 Risk (exposure estimate)").

4. **Structured execution plan** -- After 1-3 rounds of questions, the system builds a step-by-step execution plan showing which agents will run, in what order, with what dependencies, and where checkpoints will pause for your review.

5. **Interactive refinement** -- You can modify the plan before approving it: add or remove agents, adjust the order, change checkpoint placement, or ask why a particular specialist was included.

6. **Checkpoint execution** -- Once approved, the orchestrator executes the plan stage by stage, pausing at each checkpoint for you to review results, adjust the remaining plan, or save progress for later.

7. **Cross-session persistence** -- Briefing state is saved to memory after each interaction. You can close the conversation and resume later with `/bettercallclaude:briefing --resume`. All your answers, the execution plan, and any completed stages are preserved.

**Benefits**:

- **Fewer misrouted queries** -- The panel catches missing context before agents start working, reducing wasted cycles and incorrect analysis.
- **Precise execution plans** -- Instead of a generic pipeline, you get a tailored plan with the right agents in the right order for your specific matter.
- **User control** -- You see and approve the plan before execution. No surprise agent spawning or unexpected output.
- **Efficient for simple cases** -- Simple queries bypass the briefing entirely. The system only activates when complexity warrants it.
- **Resumable workflows** -- Long-running matters can be paused at any checkpoint and resumed across sessions without losing progress.

**Flags**:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--briefing` | Force full briefing session regardless of complexity |
| `--skip-briefing` / `--direct` | Bypass briefing and route directly to agents |
| `--depth quick` | Lightweight briefing: 2-3 questions, no panel |
| `--depth deep` | Maximum panel size and question rounds |
| `--resume [id]` | Resume a saved briefing session |
| `--list` | List all saved briefing sessions |

**Usage examples**:

```
# Complex matter -- triggers full briefing automatically via /legal gateway
/bettercallclaude:legal Prepare litigation for Art. 97 OR breach, CHF 500K claim,
  Zurich Commercial Court, employer is a regulated financial institution

# Explicit briefing -- forces briefing even for simpler queries
/bettercallclaude:briefing Is Art. 340 OR non-compete enforceable for a 2-year period?

# Deep briefing -- maximum panel size and question rounds
/bettercallclaude:briefing --depth deep Cross-border M&A with tax structuring,
  target in ZH, buyer in GE, FINMA-regulated entities on both sides

# Quick briefing -- lightweight intake, 2-3 questions, no panel
/bettercallclaude:briefing --depth quick Review my commercial lease for compliance

# Resume a saved briefing from a previous session
/bettercallclaude:briefing --resume brief_20260225_litigation

# List all saved briefing sessions
/bettercallclaude:briefing --list

# Skip briefing -- bypass intake and route directly to agents
/bettercallclaude:legal --skip-briefing Search BGE for Art. 41 OR tort liability

# Force briefing on a query that would normally route directly
/bettercallclaude:legal --briefing Find BGE on Art. 97 OR foreseeability
```

## Language Support

BetterCallClaude supports all four Swiss national languages plus English for legal analysis:

| Language | Code | Legal Context |
|----------|------|---------------|
| German | DE | Primary language for federal statutes (ZGB, OR, StGB). Used in ZH, BE, BS, and German-speaking cantons. |
| French | FR | Official text for CO, CC, CP. Used in GE, VD, and French-speaking cantons. Bern is bilingual (DE/FR). |
| Italian | IT | Official text for CO, CC, CP. Used in TI and Italian-speaking regions. |
| English | EN | Supported as working language with Swiss legal context. Terms are mapped to their official Swiss equivalents. |

Language detection is automatic. When you write in German, the plugin responds with German legal terminology and citation formats (BGE, Art., Abs., E.). When you write in French, it switches to ATF, art., al., and consid. formats. You can also request a specific language explicitly.

---

---

## MCP Servers

The plugin includes five pre-compiled MCP servers that provide direct integration with Swiss legal databases. See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for detailed API documentation.

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `bge-search` | Search and retrieve decisions from the BGE (Federal Supreme Court) database. Supports keyword search, article reference filtering, date ranges, and section filtering. |
| `entscheidsuche` | Search across multiple Swiss court databases including federal and cantonal courts. Supports language filtering and court-specific queries. |
| `legal-citations` | Validate citation format and existence, convert citations between DE/FR/IT/EN formats. |
| `fedlex-sparql` | Look up Swiss federal legislation via the Fedlex SPARQL endpoint. Retrieve statutes by SR number, search legislation, find related acts, get article text. |
| `onlinekommentar` | Search and retrieve Swiss legal commentaries (Kommentare). Find scholarly analysis by article reference, keyword, or legislative act. |
| `legal-persona` | Swiss-law document intelligence — strategy analysis, automated drafting, and compliance checking via MCP tools (`legal_strategy`, `legal_draft`, `legal_analyze`). |
| `tas-jurisprudence` | CAS/TAS sports arbitration awards — search, retrieve full awards, recent decisions, and browse by sport (`cas_search`, `cas_get_award`, `cas_recent`, `cas_by_sport`). |
| `swiss-caselaw` | Case law search, citation graphs, appeal chains, and doctrine via opencaselaw.ch (SSE). |
| `ollama` | Local privacy classification — routes privileged content through a local LLM to avoid cloud exposure (`ollama_check_status`). |

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 20 (only required for local Ollama invocation; the other eight MCP servers are reached over HTTPS / SSE and run no code on your machine).

Eight of the nine MCP servers are hosted remotely (seven HTTP servers at `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch`, one SSE server at `mcp.opencaselaw.ch`) and are reached by Cowork Desktop without any local build step. Only the local `ollama` server runs from a committed compiled bundle at `bettercallclaude/mcp-servers/ollama/dist/index.js`; to use it you need a running Ollama daemon (default `http://localhost:11434`, overridable via the `ollama_host` userConfig key).

All server paths and URLs are configured in `.mcp.json` using the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${user_config.*}` interpolations for portability and self-hosting (see [`docs/PRIVACY.md`](../docs/PRIVACY.md)).

---

## Privacy Protection

BetterCallClaude includes built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege) compliance.

A `PreToolUse` hook monitors outgoing tool calls for patterns that indicate privileged content. The hook scans for privilege indicators in German (Anwaltsgeheimnis, Mandantengeheimnis, vertraulich), French (secret professionnel, confidentiel, privilegie), and Italian (segreto professionale, confidenziale, privilegio).

When privileged content is detected, the hook returns an `ask` decision that prompts the user for confirmation before the tool call proceeds. This prevents accidental disclosure of attorney-client privileged material through external API calls.

The privacy system supports three modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` | All external calls require confirmation. Local processing preferred via Ollama. |
| `balanced` | Privileged content triggers confirmation. Non-privileged content processed normally. |
| `cloud` | Standard cloud processing with privacy hook active for explicit privilege markers only. |

---

## Requirements

- Cowork or Claude Code (latest version)
- Node.js >= 18 (for MCP servers)

## For Developers

Plugin resources (agents, commands, skills, hooks, `.mcp.json`) live in this repo. MCP server source code lives in the separate [`fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP`](https://github.com/fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP) repo; the HTTP aggregator there is deployed to Railway at `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch`, and this plugin's `.mcp.json` points at those remote URLs.

```bash
# Build the distributable plugin zip
npm run package
```
