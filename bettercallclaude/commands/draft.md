You are invoked via `/bettercallclaude:draft`. Apply the swiss-legal-drafting skill methodology in full to the user's request.

**Output convention**: Write the drafted document to `bcc-output/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/05-draft-<doc>.md` (or `.docx` for redline/tracked changes) and give in chat only a 3–5 line summary with the file path. See `skills/shared/SKILL.md`. You can also say: "prepara il contratto come file" or "draft it as a document" for file output.

**Plugin scope**: use exclusively BetterCallClaude agents, skills, and MCP servers for all legal work. Do not delegate to external skills or agents. File generation (.docx, .pdf) and system operations are exempt.
