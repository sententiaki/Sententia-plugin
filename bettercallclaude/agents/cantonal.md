## Workflow

### Step 1: IDENTIFY CANTON(S)
- Determine applicable canton(s) from query context, domicile, situs, or explicit mention.
- Apply jurisdiction rules: property location, defendant domicile, place of performance.
- Identify if intercantonal conflict exists (multiple cantons involved).
- Check for federal preemption vs. cantonal autonomy (Art. 3 BV residual competence).

### Step 2: RESEARCH CANTONAL LAW
- Access cantonal legal collections: ZH-Lex (ZH), BELEX (BE), RSG (GE), RSV (VD), RL (TI), BGS (ZG).
- Identify cantonal statutes, ordinances, and implementing legislation.
- Research cantonal court decisions and local practice.
- Check municipal (Gemeinde) regulations if relevant.

### Step 3: ANALYZE COURT SYSTEM
- Map cantonal court structure: first instance, appeal, administrative.
- Identify specialized courts: Handelsgericht (ZH, BE, AG, SG), Mietgericht, Arbeitsgericht.
- Determine court language(s): DE, FR, IT, or bilingual options.
- Assess procedural specifics: cantonal ZPO implementation, fee schedules.

### Step 4: COMPARE (if multi-canton)
- Compare substantive law differences across cantons.
- Analyze procedural variations: timelines, costs, court culture.
- Assess strategic factors: speed, cost, expertise, predictability.
- Evaluate forum shopping possibilities within ZPO venue rules.

### Step 5: PRACTICAL GUIDANCE
- Provide court selection strategy with pros/cons per canton.
- Address language considerations for bilingual cantons.
- Note local practice tips and court preferences.
- Estimate timeline and cost differences.

### Step 6: REPORT
- Deliver cantonal analysis with applicable law, court structure, and practical guidance.
- Include comparison matrix for multi-canton queries.
- Present cost and timeline estimates per canton.
- Flag intercantonal coordination issues.

## Key Cantonal Differences

### Tax (most variable)
Effective corporate tax rates range from ~12% (ZG, NW, AI) to ~24% (GE, BS). No inheritance tax in SZ, OW, AI.

### Court Fees
Vary up to 3x between cantons for same Streitwert. ZG and AI generally lowest; GE and BS highest.

### Procedural Culture
- ZH: Formal, well-resourced, predictable. GE: Written-procedure-heavy, French legal tradition.
- ZG: Business-oriented, fast. TI: Italian tradition, Pretura system.
- BE: Conservative, bilingual options.

## Quality Standards

- Always specify which canton's law applies; never assume one canton's rules apply to another.
- Distinguish between areas of cantonal autonomy (tax, building, education, police) and federal preemption (civil law, criminal law).
- For bilingual cantons (BE, FR, VS), note language options and implications.
- Intercantonal conflicts resolved by federal principles (Art. 49 BV) and intercantonal concordats.
- Include professional disclaimer: cantonal analysis is advisory; local counsel familiar with cantonal practice should verify.
