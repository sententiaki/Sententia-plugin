## Legal Framework Coverage

### Property Law (ZGB)
- Ownership (Art. 641-729 ZGB), servitudes (Art. 730-781), liens and mortgages (Art. 793-915).
- Condominium ownership (Stockwerkeigentum, Art. 712a-712t ZGB).
- Land register (Grundbuch, Art. 942-977 ZGB): registration, priority, good faith protection.

### Construction Law
- Werkvertrag (Art. 363-379 OR), architect contracts.
- Bauhandwerkerpfandrecht (construction lien, Art. 837-841 ZGB).
- SIA Normen (Swiss industry standards: SIA 118, SIA 102, SIA 108).
- Cantonal building laws, RPG (Raumplanungsgesetz), zoning regulations.

### Lex Koller (BGBB/LFAIE)
- Foreign ownership restrictions under Bundesgesetz uber den Erwerb von Grundstucken durch Personen im Ausland.
- Permit requirements, exemptions (EU/EFTA citizens, Swiss residents, commercial property).
- Cantonal quotas and approval procedures.

### Tenancy Law (Mietrecht, OR Art. 253-304)
- Residential: rent control, termination protection, initial rent challenges.
- Commercial: greater party autonomy, indexation clauses, assignment/subletting.
- Cantonal conciliation authorities (Schlichtungsbehorde/autorite de conciliation).

## Workflow

### Step 1: IDENTIFY PROPERTY
- Obtain land register extract (Grundbuchauszug): ownership, encumbrances, liens.
- Review cadastral data, building records, and zoning classification.
- Determine property type: residential, commercial, mixed-use, agricultural.
- Identify cantonal jurisdiction and applicable local regulations.

### Step 2: LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE
- Verify title and chain of ownership.
- Analyze servitudes (Wegrecht, Baurecht, Dienstbarkeiten) and their practical impact.
- Review mortgage and lien entries (Grundpfandverschreibung, Schuldbrief).
- Check annotations: pre-emption rights (Vorkaufsrecht), purchase options.
- Assess public law restrictions: zoning compliance, building permits, environmental.

### Step 3: LEX KOLLER ANALYSIS
- Classify buyer: Swiss national, EU/EFTA citizen, third-country national.
- Classify property: residential, commercial, mixed-use, agricultural.
- Determine if permit required; identify applicable exemptions.
- Advise on structuring to comply with foreign ownership rules.

### Step 4: TRANSACTION STRUCTURE
- Draft or review purchase agreement with conditions precedent.
- Structure payment mechanics and escrow arrangements.
- Address warranty provisions: title, encumbrances, building condition, environmental.
- Plan closing: notarization, land register application, tax declarations.

### Step 5: CONSTRUCTION / TENANCY (if applicable)
- Review construction contracts against SIA standards.
- Check for Bauhandwerkerpfandrecht exposure (4-month registration deadline).
- Analyze lease agreements: rent level, termination provisions, renewal terms.
- Assess cantonal-specific tenant protections.

### Step 6: REPORT
- Deliver property analysis with Grundbuch summary, zoning assessment, and lex Koller determination.
- Include transaction structure recommendations, cost estimates, and timeline.
- Present risk assessment covering title, encumbrances, environmental, and construction defects.

## Quality Standards

- Grundbuch analysis must cover all four sections (A: ownership, B: servitudes, C: liens, D: annotations).
- Lex Koller assessment must consider both buyer nationality/residence AND property classification.
- Construction lien (Bauhandwerkerpfandrecht) deadlines are strict: 4 months from completion.
- Cantonal differences in property transfer tax are significant (0% in ZH, up to 3.3% elsewhere).
- SIA Normen are industry standards, not law; their contractual incorporation must be explicit.
- Include professional disclaimer: real estate analysis is advisory; notary and legal review required for transactions.
