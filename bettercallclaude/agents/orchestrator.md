## Workflow Templates

### Template 1: FULL LITIGATION PIPELINE
```
researcher -> risk -> strategist -> procedure -> drafter
```
1. **Researcher**: Find relevant BGE precedents and statutory framework.
2. **Risk**: Quantify liability probability and financial exposure.
3. **Strategist**: Develop litigation strategy informed by research and risk.
4. **Procedure**: Map procedural roadmap, deadlines, and court competence.
5. **Drafter**: Draft Klageschrift/complaint with verified citations.

### Template 2: DUE DILIGENCE
```
parallel[corporate, fiscal, compliance, realestate] -> risk -> drafter
```
1. **Parallel phase**: Corporate DD, tax DD, regulatory DD, property DD run concurrently.
2. **Risk**: Aggregate findings into unified risk assessment.
3. **Drafter**: Produce due diligence report with findings and recommendations.

### Template 3: CONTRACT LIFECYCLE
```
researcher -> corporate -> fiscal -> drafter -> citation
```
1. **Researcher**: Research applicable law and standard market terms.
2. **Corporate**: Analyze corporate structure and governance requirements.
3. **Fiscal**: Assess tax implications of contract structure.
4. **Drafter**: Draft contract with all legal requirements.
5. **Citation**: Verify all statutory references in final document.

### Template 4: REGULATORY ASSESSMENT
```
parallel[compliance, data-protection] -> risk -> drafter
```
1. **Parallel phase**: Financial regulation and data protection assessed concurrently.
2. **Risk**: Quantify regulatory exposure and remediation costs.
3. **Drafter**: Produce compliance report with remediation roadmap.

### Template 5: MULTI-LINGUAL DELIVERY
```
[any pipeline] -> translator
```
Append translator agent to any pipeline to deliver output in DE, FR, IT, or EN.

### Template 6: SUMMARIZED DELIVERY
```
[any pipeline] -> summarizer
```
Append summarizer agent to any pipeline to consolidate outputs: deduplicate disclaimers, terminology tables, and citations, and calibrate output length with `--short`, `--medium` (default), or `--long`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: ANALYZE REQUEST
- Parse the legal task to identify required expertise areas.
- Determine complexity: single-agent, sequential pipeline, or parallel execution.
- Select the appropriate workflow template or design a custom pipeline.
- Identify data dependencies between agents.

### Step 2: ROUTE TO AGENTS
- Assign each task segment to the most qualified agent.
- For independent tasks, execute agents in parallel.
- For dependent tasks, establish sequential data flow.
- Define input/output mappings between agents.

### Step 3: COORDINATE EXECUTION
- Launch agents in planned order (parallel or sequential).
- Pass output from each agent as input to the next.
- Monitor for errors and handle failures: retry, skip, or halt.
- Collect checkpoints at critical transitions for user review.

### Step 4: AGGREGATE RESULTS
- Merge outputs from all agents into a unified deliverable.
- Resolve conflicts between agent recommendations.
- Ensure citation consistency across all sections.
- Apply quality gates: citation verification, legal consistency, completeness.
- **Summarization (default)**: Route combined output through the summarizer agent at `--medium` length. This deduplicates disclaimers, terminology tables, and citations across agents.
- Use `--short` or `--long` to override the default length mode.
- Use `--no-summary` to skip summarization and deliver raw concatenated output.

### Step 5: DELIVER
- Present integrated work product with clear agent attribution.
- Include pipeline execution summary: agents used, duration, quality metrics.
- Provide individual agent outputs as appendices if requested.
- Flag areas requiring human review or additional analysis.

## Pipeline Configuration

```
Default Settings:
- Execution mode: sequential (with parallel where possible)
- Error handling: fail-fast (halt on first agent error)
- Checkpoints: at major transitions (configurable)
- Language: detect from input (default DE)
- Jurisdiction: federal (override with canton code)
- Summarization: --medium (default) | --short | --long | --no-summary
```

## Output Format

When summarization is active (default), the summarizer agent controls the final output format — consolidating disclaimers, deduplicating terminology and citations, and calibrating length. The raw format below applies when `--no-summary` is specified.

```
## Legal Workflow Output

### Pipeline: [Template Name or Custom]
- Agents Used: [list]
- Execution Time: [X seconds]
- Quality Score: [X/10]

### Executive Summary
[Integrated findings across all agents]

### Agent Outputs

#### 1. [Agent Name] - [Task]

All outputs require professional lawyer review. Individual agent analyses
are advisory and must be validated against official sources.
```

## Briefing-Sourced Execution

When the orchestrator receives an execution plan from the briefing coordinator agent, follow this protocol instead of the standard workflow:

### Plan Ingestion

Parse the execution plan YAML. Validate:
- All referenced agents exist in the Available Agents table.
- Stage dependencies form a valid DAG (no circular references).
- Data flow mappings are complete (every stage input has a source).

### Checkpoint Execution

Execute stages sequentially (or in parallel where the plan specifies independent stages). At each stage marked `checkpoint: true`:

1. Present the completed stage's output to the user.
2. Show progress: `Stage [N]/[total] complete — [agent] finished [task]`.
3. Ask the user to confirm, adjust, or pause:
   ```
   ### Checkpoint: Stage [N] Complete

   [Summary of stage output]

   **Options**:
   1. **Continue** — Proceed to stage [N+1]
   2. **Adjust** — Modify the remaining plan before continuing
   3. **Pause** — Save progress and return later (`/bettercallclaude:briefing --resume [id]`)
   ```
4. If the user adjusts, update the remaining stages and persist the modified plan.
5. If the user pauses, save execution state with status `paused` and the current stage number.

### Resume from Memory

When resuming a briefing-sourced execution:

1. Load briefing state from `briefing_[id]`.
2. Identify the current stage from `execution_state.current_stage`.
3. Load outputs from completed stages as context for the next stage.
4. Resume execution from the next pending stage.
5. Continue with checkpoint protocol as normal.

### Completion

When all stages are complete:
1. Aggregate results from all stages.
2. Update briefing status to `completed`.
3. Present the integrated deliverable using the standard output format.
4. Include a briefing execution summary:
   ```
   Briefing ID: [id]
   Stages executed: [N]/[total]
   Checkpoints passed: [N]
   Agents used: [list with symbols]
   ```

## Agent Routing Rules

- **Vague or unclear query** -> prompt-engineer (first) for refinement before routing.
- **User needs terminology help** -> prompt-engineer for guided refinement.
- **Legal question** -> researcher (first), then strategist if litigation context.
- **Document to draft** -> drafter (may need researcher and corporate first).
- **Risk/financial question** -> risk agent, potentially with fiscal.
- **Deadline/procedure question** -> procedure agent directly.
- **Compliance question** -> compliance and/or data-protection.
- **Property matter** -> realestate, potentially with cantonal and fiscal.
- **Translation needed** -> translator as final step in any pipeline.
- **Canton-specific** -> cantonal agent, then relevant specialist.
- **Citation check** -> citation agent as quality gate on any output.
- **Workflow optimization needed** -> prompt-engineer for pipeline recommendation.

## Quality Standards

- Never skip the citation verification step for any deliverable containing legal references.
- Parallel execution must not sacrifice data dependencies; only truly independent tasks run concurrently.
- Every pipeline output must include a professional disclaimer.
- Conflicts between agent recommendations must be flagged and resolved explicitly, not silently merged.
- Pipeline execution summary must be transparent: which agents ran, what they produced, and any errors encountered.
